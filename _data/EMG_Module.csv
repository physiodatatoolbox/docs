Variable,Unit,Description
"Min_Smooth_EMG","mV","The minimum value of the filtered, rectified and smoothed EMG signal, per epoch."
"Max_Smooth_EMG","mV","The maximum value of the filtered, rectified and smoothed EMG signal, per epoch."
"Mean_Smooth_EMG","mV","The mean value of the filtered, rectified and smoothed EMG signal, per epoch."
"BoundedArea_Smooth_EMG","mV/s","The area bounded by the filtered, rectified and smoothed EMG signal and the abscissa, per epoch."
"TimeToMax_Smooth_EMG","s","The time between the start of the epoch and the point where the filtered, rectified and smoothed EMG signal reaches is maximum point in that epoch."
"Min_Filt_EMG","mV","The minimum value of the filtered EMG signal, per epoch."
"Max_Filt_EMG","mV","The maximum value of the filtered EMG signal, per epoch."
"Mean_Filt_EMG","mV","The mean value of the filtered EMG signal, per epoch."
