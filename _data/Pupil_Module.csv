Variable,Unit,Description
"meanDia_BothEyes","mm","The mean pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of both pupils."
"minDia_BothEyes","mm","The minimum pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of both pupils."
"maxDia_BothEyes","mm","The maximum pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of both pupils."
"signalCoverage_BothEyes","%","The approximate percentage of the epoch in which data from the interpolated signal is available."
"meanDia_LeftEye","mm","The mean pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of the left pupil."
"minDia_LeftEye","mm","The minimum pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of the left pupil."
"maxDia_LeftEye","mm","The maximum pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of the left pupil."
"signalCoverage_LeftEye","%","The approximate percentage of the epoch in which data from the interpolated signal is available."
"meanDia_RightEye","mm","The mean pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of the right pupil."
"minDia_RightEye","mm","The minimum pupil diameter, calculated per epoch from the interpolated and smoothed signal generated from the valid samples of the right pupil."

"countRawSamples_LeftEye","-","The total number of left eye raw pupil diameter samples inside the epoch. Only Non-NaN samples are counted."

"countValidSamples_RightEye","-","The count of the valid right eye pupil diameter samples inside the epoch. The 'valid samples' are the samples that were not rejected by the filters or the user, and were used to generate the interpolated signal."
"meanValidSamples_RightEye","mm","The mean of the valid right eye pupil diameter samples inside the epoch."
"minValidSamples_RightEye","mm","The minimum of the valid right eye pupil diameter samples inside the epoch."
"maxValidSamples_RightEye","mm","The maximum of the valid right eye pupil diameter samples inside the epoch."
