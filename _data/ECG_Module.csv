Variable,Unit,Description
"HR_mean","BPM","Mean of the continuous Heart Rate, as interpolated from the accepted IBI data points."
"R_peakCount","count","Count of accepted R-peaks inside current epoch."
"IBI_mean","s","Arithmetic mean of the accepted discrete IBIs. IBI values are defined as: IBI(n) = Rt(n)-Rt(n-1), and are timestamped using: IBIt(n) = Rt(n)."
"IBI_weighted_mean","s","Self-weighted mean of the accepted discrete IBIs; i.e., sum(IBIs.^2)/sum(IBIs)."
"IBI_min","s","Min value of the accepted discrete IBI data points."
"IBI_max","s","Max value of the accepted discrete IBI data points."
"IBI_std","s","Standard Deviation of the accepted discrete IBI data points (SD normalized by (N-1), where N is the sample size)."
"IBI_count","count","Count of accepted IBI data points inside current epoch."
"IBI_coverage","%","The percentage-wise IBI coverage of the epoch; i.e., 100*(sum of the IBIs)/(Epoch Duration)."
"HRV_rmssd","ms","The Root Mean Squared of the Differences between Successive IBIs (nonadjacent IBIs disregarded)."
"HRV_ssdCount","count","Count of succesive IBIs inside current epoch. Nonadjacent IBIs are not considered succesive."
"HRV_pNN20","%","Percentage of absolute differences between successive IBIs that are greater than 20 ms."
"HRV_pNN50","%","Percentage of absolute differences between successive IBIs that are greater than 50 ms."
