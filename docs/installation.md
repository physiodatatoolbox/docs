# Installation
Before running the Toolbox, download and install the free [MATLAB 2020b Component Runtime (v9.9)](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). You will need admin rights to install it. Ask your IT department to install if you don't have the necessary permissions.

If you already have MATLAB 2020b **including the Compiler Toolbox**, you should already have the correct runtime installed.

Once the MATLAB runtime is ready:

 - Download and unpack the [Toolbox zip file](#download-and-installation), preferable to local storage.
 - Run the **PhysioDataToolbox.exe** file.

If this is your first time using the Toolbox, follow the [Basic Walkthrough](.\tutorial\basics.md) to get acquainted with the Toolbox features.

## SmartScreen Warning ##
When running PhysioDataToolbox.exe for the first time, especially recently released versions, you might get a Windows 10 SmartScreen warning. This is because even though the PhysioData Toolbox executable is signed, it is considered _unrecognized_ until it has built a reputation with the Microsoft SmartScreen system (see [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/139520) for more info).

To run the Toolbox anyway, click **More Info**, then **Run anyway**.

# Troubleshooting

 - **Ensure correct runtime installation**:  
    Make sure that the correct version (2020b, v9.9) of the MATLAB Component Runtime has been properly installed. An older or newer version will not suffice.

 - **Unpack zip to suitable location:**  
    Before running the Toolbox executables, please ensure that the zip file is unpacked to a folder where you have write-access, preferably on a local drive. Additionally, do not put the Toolbox in a folder controlled by a file-synchronization service (e.g. Dropbox).

 - **Wait:**  
    When running PhysioDataToolbox.exe for the first time, it will attempt to create a folder named PhysioDataToolbox_mcr in the same directory as the executable, and unpack its dependencies there. This may take **several minutes**, especially when running the Toolbox on network or non-SSD drives. Please be patient. Subsequent launches should be much faster.

 - **Ask for help:**  
    Contact the [developers](#license-and-support) and explain your predicament.
