# Download and Installation
{: .pdt-abstract-title, .no_toc}

The PhysioData Toolbox can be downloaded as a zip file containing the executables and supplementary files:
{: .pdt-abstract-body}

‚ùó **The Toolbox is only compatible with Windows.**
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 .ml-4}

[PhysioData Toolbox v{{ site.pdt_version }}]({{ site.pdt_download_url }}){: .pdt-btn style="width: 320px; text-align: center;"}


The Toolbox requires the free {{ site.pdt_mcr_ver_long }}:

The PDT website does not currently include any FSW specific info; only info about the Toolbox. As such, FSW specific info has been temporarily disabled.
Users should check the Wiki instead.

# Installation #
Before running the Toolbox, download and install the free [{{ site.pdt_mcr_ver_long }}](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). You will need admin rights to install it. Ask your IT department to install it if you don't have the necessary permissions.

If you already have MATLAB {{ site.pdt_matlab_ver }} **including the Compiler Toolbox**, you should already have the correct runtime installed.

{% if show_fsw_info %}If you want to run the Toolbox on a **Leiden University** owned PC, please see [below](#leiden-university).{% endif %}

Once the MATLAB runtime is ready:
 - Download and unpack the [Toolbox zip file](#download-and-installation), preferably to local storage.
 - Run the **PhysioDataToolbox.exe** file.

If this is your first time using the Toolbox, follow the [Basic Walkthrough](.\tutorial\basics.html) to get acquainted with the Toolbox features.

## SmartScreen Warning ##
When running PhysioDataToolbox.exe for the first time, especially recently released versions, you might get a Windows 10 SmartScreen warning. This is because even though the PhysioData Toolbox executable is signed, it is considered _unrecognized_ until it has built a reputation with the Microsoft SmartScreen system ([more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SmartScreen#Code_Signing_Certificates)).

To run the Toolbox anyway, click **More Info**, then **Run anyway**.

{% if show_fsw_info %}
## Leiden University ##
Leiden University researchers wishing to run the PhysioData Toolbox on their managed work PCs can ask the ISSC to install the correct MATLAB runtime  for them ({{ site.pdt_mcr_ver_long }}). This should be done through the ISSC's [helpdesk portal](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/) (Software & web services ‚á® Install or request software ‚á® Request software). Since this is free software, a 0 can be entered in the required SAP field.

Alternatively, students and researchers at the FSW can make use of the PCs in the Data analysis room (1B02) to run the Toolbox. These PCs already have MATLAB and various Toolbox versions installed (see the "PhysioData Toolbox" folder on the desktop). More info about 1B02 can be found on its [Wiki page](https://researchwiki.solo.universiteitleiden.nl/xwiki/wiki/researchwiki.solo.universiteitleiden.nl/view/Facilities/Researchdata%20analysis%20room/).

The Toolbox will run fine through Remote Desktop, but is not compatible with Citrix.

# License and Support
The Toolbox is in active development and is made freely available 'as is' to students and researchers. The software has undergone thorough testing and validation, but is presented without guarantee, and without warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Always double-check the results, and please report any errors, inconsistencies and suggestions to the development team.

The PhysioData Toolbox is meant strictly for non-diagnostic, non-medical and non-commercial use.

This Toolbox sends anonymous usage data to an online analytics server for tracking how often the Toolbox and its various features are used. These data are necessary for rationalizing the continued development and maintenance of the Toolbox and its components. No physiological (meta)data, analysis results or personally identifiable information is collected.

# Troubleshooting

 - **Ensure correct runtime installation**:  
    Make sure that the correct version of the MATLAB Component Runtime--{{ site.pdt_mcr_ver_long }}--has been properly installed. An older or newer version will not suffice.

 - **Unpack zip to suitable location:**  
    Before running the Toolbox executables, please ensure that the zip file is unpacked to a folder where you have write-access, preferably on a local drive. Additionally, do not put the Toolbox in a folder controlled by a file-synchronization service (e.g. Dropbox).

 - **Wait:**  
    When running PhysioDataToolbox.exe for the first time, it will attempt to create a folder named PhysioDataToolbox_mcr in the same directory as the executable, and unpack its dependencies there. This may take **several minutes**, especially when running the Toolbox on network or non-SSD drives. Please be patient. Subsequent launches should be much faster.

 - **Ask for help:**  
    Contact the [developers](./about.html) and explain your predicament.
