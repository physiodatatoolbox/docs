# Version Compatibility #
Although the Toolbox can generally open files from older versions, it is not guaranteed that the results obtained in different PhysioData Toolbox versions are completely equal, nor that newer versions of PhysioAnalyzer modules properly parse old parameters. It is therefore not advisable to directly compare data analyzed using different Toolbox versions; i.e., **only use one version of the Toolbox for a given study**, if possible. In any case, always double-check the PhysioAnalyzer data, settings and user-corrections when loading older files, and always validate the results.

## PhysioData Toolbox v0.7.0 (Latest)
PhysioData Toolbox version 0.7.0 contains several user experience enhancements and under-the-hood improvements. It was released on {{ site.pdt_release_date_str }}. Download it [here](./installation.html).

 - **New file-conversion features:**  
     - A PyGaze interpretation mode has been added to the [Tobii](./user-guide/file-converter.html#opensesame-and-pygaze) and [EyeLink](./user-guide/file-converter.html#eyelink) converters.
     - The Tobii converter can now convert [plof files](./user-guide/file-converter.html#tobii-pro-lab), allowing analysis of Tobii Pro Lab pupil size data.
     - The [EyeLink](./user-guide/file-converter.html#eyelink) converter can now parse DataViewer trials.
     - The [BIOPAC](./user-guide/file-converter.html#biopac-files) converter now supports acq files up to version 5.0.8.
     - Generic [eye-tracking](./user-guide/file-converter.html#eye-tracking-tsv-file-converter) and [signal](./user-guide/file-converter.html#signal-tsv-file-converter) TSV file converters have been added.
     - Many more.

 - **New analysis and processing features:**  
     - The [Blood Pressure](./user-guide/physioanalyzer-modules/bp-module.html) module now features enhanced UX and NIBP-100E event detection.
     - The [ECG module](./user-guide/physioanalyzer-modules/ecg-module.html) now outputs a list of all IBIs.
     - The [epoch](./user-guide/epochs.html) generation engine can now use the `AFTER` and `BEFORE` [keywords](./user-guide/epochs.html#relative-occurrences).
     - The [Epoch Builder](./user-guide/epochs.html/#epoch-builder) can now [highlight](./user-guide/epochs.html#epoch-builder-menus) all epochs generated by a specific definition row. This is activated via the definition table context menu (right-click in the cells). 
     - Eye-tracker metadata is now included in the analysis output.
     - Many more.

 - **Other new features:**  
     - he documentation has been improved.
     - The GUI has been simplified and now provides more real-estate for graphs.
     - The Toolbox no longer collects any anonymous usage data--no analytics is performed at all any more. As such, feedback on usage is greatly appreciated and will help motivate the mobilization of development effort.
     - The PhysioData Analyzer window menu and the settings dialog now contain direct links to relevant documentation.
     - Many more.

 - **Bug fixes:**  
     - The File Converter table (and others) no longer bug-out when the DPI is not 100%.
     - The Skin Conductance module no longer crashes when exactly one SCR is detected.
     - Many, many more.

## PhysioData Toolbox v0.6.3
PhysioData Toolbox version 0.6.3 contains several minor bugfixes and improvements.  It was released on {{ site.pdt_version_archive | where: "pdt_version", "0.6.3" | map: 'pdt_release_date_str'}}. Download it [here]({{ site.pdt_version_archive | where: "pdt_version", "0.6.3" | map: 'pdt_download_url'}}).

 - **Bug fixes and improvements:**  
     - Fixed an issue that may cause referenceable events to be plotted in an incorrect graph.
     - The Pupil size module's fast-mode has been improved and documented ([link](./user-guide/physioanalyzer-modules/pupil-module.html#fast-mode)).
     - The minimum selection size has been decreased (narrower areas can now be selected).
     - Resampling timestamps (in the `time_Epoch` variable) are now rounded to the nearest 0.0001 second to avoid floating point errors from preventing equivalent time-points from being grouped together. Additionally, the variable `resampled_index` has been added, which indicates the index of the resampled data-point.
     - Other minor GUI corrections and framework updates.
